# MPESA Golang API Wrapper

The wrapper provides convenient access to the [Safaricom MPESA G2 API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/apis) from applications written in server-side Golang. 

**This is Work in Progress!**

## Installing
You can install the package by running:

```
go get github.com/safaricom/mpesa-api-go
```

## Usage
The package needs to be configured with your **appKey** and **appSecret** which can be obtained from Safaricom.

```
const (
	appKey = "YOUR_APP_KEY"		    
	appSecret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"	   
)
```
